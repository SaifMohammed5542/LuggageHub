        <p>
          Luggage Terminal does not ship physical products. 
          Instead, we provide on-location services such as luggage storage and key handover 
          at the station selected during your booking.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem', color: '#235789' }}>1. Booking Confirmation</h3>
        <p>
          Once your booking and payment are completed, you will receive a confirmation email 
          with your booking details. Please keep this confirmation for check-in at the station.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem', color: '#235789' }}>2. Service Fulfilment</h3>
        <p>
          Our services are delivered at the exact location, date, and time you selected during booking. 
          Customers must arrive at the station and show their booking confirmation to access the service.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem', color: '#235789' }}>3. No Physical Shipping</h3>
        <p>
          Since our services are location-based, no physical goods are shipped. 
          All bookings are service-only and fulfilled in person.
        </p>
